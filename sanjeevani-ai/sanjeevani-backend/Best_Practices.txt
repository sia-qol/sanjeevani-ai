They use two terminal tabs or windows:

Frontend tab
    cd sanjeevani-ai
    npm run dev
    Backend tab

Backend tab
    cd sanjeevani-backend
    uvicorn main:app --reload
   
Now, Each runs on a different port:


Layer	Port	Purpose
Frontend	localhost:5173	UI for user interaction (React)
Backend	localhost:8000	API that responds using LLM
They operate independently but talk to each other over HTTP.
